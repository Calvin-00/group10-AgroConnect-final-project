A Platform for Connecting Farmers in Rwanda to Agricultural Markets.

Project Title: AgroConnect - A Platform for Connecting Farmers in Rwanda to Agricultural Markets
Problem Statement:

Farming agriculture is a critical sector in Rwanda, contributing to food security, poverty reduction, and economic development. However, many smallholder farmers struggle to access agricultural markets, finance, and information, hindering their productivity and profitability. This results in low incomes, poverty, and decreased motivation to farm.

Solution:

The AgroConnect project aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for connecting farmers in Rwanda to agricultural markets. The platform will have the following features:
1.	Farmer registration and profile: Farmers can register on the website and create their profiles, which will include their farm details, crops they grow, and their contact information.
2.	Crop catalog: The website will have a catalog of agricultural products, including crops, livestock, and agricultural inputs. The catalog will be searchable and filterable by crop type, price, and location.
3.	Direct trade: Farmers can list their products on the platform and sell them directly to local and regional buyers, eliminating intermediaries and increasing their profit margins.

Tools and Technologies that shall be used:
1.	Star UML
2.	ASP .NET Core 5.0
3.	Entity Framework Core 5.0
4.	SQL Server
5.	Bootstrap 4

 

Conclusion:

The AgroConnect project will provide a platform for connecting farmers in Rwanda to agricultural markets, enabling them to access finance, information, and markets and improve their livelihoods. The project will help to promote sustainable farming practices, increase the quality and quantity of agricultural products, and contribute to the economic development of Rwanda.
